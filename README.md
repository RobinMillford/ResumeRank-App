## Objective

The objective of this app is to streamline the process of screening resumes by automating the matching process. Traditional methods of resume screening can be time-consuming and subjective. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this app aims to provide a more efficient and objective way to match job descriptions with candidate resumes.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Resumes**: Click on the "Upload resume data (CSV)" button and select a CSV file containing resume data. The CSV file should contain two columns: "ID" and "Resume_str", where "ID" is a unique identifier for each resume and "Resume_str" contains the text of the resumes.

2. **Enter Job Description**: Enter the job description in the text area provided.

3. **Match Resumes**: Click on the "Match Resumes" button to initiate the matching process.

4. **View Results**: The top 10 matches will be displayed, showing the resume ID, resume text, and similarity score.
